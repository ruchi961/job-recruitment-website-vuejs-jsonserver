Younger workers change every three years. You would think this type of job hopping in the market would make it easier for companies to pick up top talent. However, making a hire and making an outstanding hire are two different things, and the difference can affect your bottom line.\r\n\r\n            So, how can companies excel at finding top talent instead of merely filling open positions? Gone are the days of posting a single ad on a recruiting website and hoping you’ll attract that next superstar candidate. With today’s competitive job market, the time has come for employers to get more creative in their recruiting efforts and seek out recruiting tips wherever they can.\r\n\r\n            Over 80 percent of hiring managers and human resources professionals say hiring talent is their top concern. Organizations should cast a wide net when searching for potential candidates. Recruiting managers should understand what’s attractive to potential employees. What motivates them? What attracts them? What makes your organization stand out to candidates looking for their next position? Where are candidates looking for their next job?\r\n\r\n            By expanding your recruiting methods, and becoming more creative in the process, you’ll be able to attract those stellar candidates to your company.\r\n\r\n            Let’s look at three tips for finding top talent.<br>\r\n            <div style=\"border:2px solid green\">\r\n            <span style=\"font-size:22px;margin-left: 40%;\"><b>Develop a Talent Strategy</b></span><br>\r\n            You need to look at your current talent strategy. Don’t have one? It’s time to develop your organization’s plan for talent acquisition.\r\n\r\nStart by identifying what you expect from every role and position in your organization, from the top down. Write a job description for each role. Create inputs and outputs. Not only does this help you get a better grasp on your open positions, but it also enables you to recruit and hire people who fit with your company and fit the job for which they’re interviewing.\r\n\r\nWhen people are hired for roles that play to their strengths, they are more engaged, efficient, and productive. They thrive in their positions and are successful. This helps the company succeed as well.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you don’t delve into the position itself and understand its role within the larger organization, how do you know who to recruit for that position? Just hiring to hire is not a strategy. It’s a recipe for disaster.\r\n\r\nTake the time to create a talent strategy and watch your company thrive.\r\n            </div><br>\r\n            <div style=\"border:2px solid green\">\r\n            <span style=\"font-size:22px;margin-left: 38%;\"><b>Identify Your Ideal Job Candidate</b></span><br>\r\n            Once you’ve developed your talent strategy, it’s time to identify the ideal job candidate. Who would be best for the role for which you’re hiring? What are the values and attributes a candidate would need to possess? What skills and experiences are required? How should this person handle complex challenges? How should this person communicate? Or lead a team?\r\n\r\nGet some feedback from the employees in the division or department where the role is available. What are their thoughts on an ideal candidate?\r\n\r\nDo you currently have a high-performing employee in the same or a similar position? What makes that employee so great? What skills and attributes allow that employee to achieve success in that role? Jot down those attributes and let those serve as a barometer for the position. Then, find the candidate to fit those attributes.\r\n\r\nAsk pointed questions in interviews. Give the candidate the chance to tell you about how he or she handled a big success or a big failure. How does that candidate work under stress? How does he or she handle challenges or interpersonal relationships? Provide scenarios and let your candidate respond. Get to know your candidate during the interview process. Make sure they fit the role for which your interviewing.\r\n\r\nA CareerBuilder survey stated that 43 percent of the respondents made bad hires because of the pressure to hire someone quickly. Whether the urgency was caused by other employees leaving or current employees being overworked, hiring a someone without vetting that person to see if he or she is the right fit isn’t good for the company—or that new employee.\r\n\r\nIf organizations hire without taking the time to identify the ideal job candidate, then you may have inadvertently created a revolving door issue—employees leave shortly after being hired. This isn’t a good look for prospective employees.\r\n            </div><br>\r\n            <div style=\"border:2px solid green\">\r\n                <span style=\"font-size:22px;margin-left: 38%;\"><b>Create a Great Candidate Experience</b></span><br>\r\n                From the moment the candidate reviews your job posting, to when they come in for an interview or two, to when you follow-up with them, create an experience. Many top hiring managers emphasize the importance of creating a stellar candidate experience - and it starts with pretty simple things. For example, introduce them to the team they might work with. Show them around the office. Let them see how you operate and function. \r\n\r\nWhen you have a referred candidate come in during the recruiting process, personalize the interview. Acknowledge that they’re a referral. Offer top-shelf customer service to them. Involve the employee who referred them to the company.\r\n\r\nNot all candidates, or even referred candidates, will get an offer from your company. When you reject a candidate, do so with a personalized letter or email. Let them know why they weren’t hired. Give them suggestions for future roles, at your company or other companies. You never know, you may have an opportunity to hire that candidate at a future date.\r\n\r\nTop talent does exist. However, with today’s highly competitive market, it’s harder to find than ever. Use the tips above to boost your recruiting practices. By using creative and innovative strategies, you’ll find ideal candidates. As a bonus, you’ll impress your current employees and increase your retention of both existing employees and new employees along the way.\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n<script>\r\n// export default {\r\n\r\n// }\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n#main{\r\n    margin-left: 200px;\r\n}\r\n</style>"],"sourceRoot":"src/components"}]}
